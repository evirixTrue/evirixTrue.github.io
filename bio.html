<article class="bio">
<p>Inherently neat and well organized, my design production follows suit with a clean, minimal look.  However, I also enjoy including more creative elements when illustration is applicable. In 2006 I earned a BFA at the College of Fine Arts at Boston University with a major in graphic design and a minor in art history.  I work full time as a production artist for American Directory Systems in Malvern, PA. I also freelance. Most of my freelance work is made up of logo and jersey designs for ultimate frisbee leagues and teams. I discovered ultimate at college, immediately fell in love with it and never looked back. I have designed numerous logos for the Philadelphia Area Disc Alliance, and I have designed jerseys for several club, college, and high school teams. I have also designed several logos and advertisements for local musicians. Besides design and ultimate, almost all my interests are invested in one supreme passion: my love for music.</p>
